### About Me
Hi there!

I got a bachelor’s in web design and later walked my path to a web developer career. I have been working as an HTML coder for the past few years and I love it!
But now it's time to move on and develop new experiences based on the knowledge I got from my career, the university and front-end courses to improve myself and be ready to take any challenge I'll see on my way. 

I believe that my strong desire to learn new skills will help me become an expert.
